## Description

Include a short description of the changes and the OpenSpec change set name.

## Checklist
- [ ] I added or updated OpenSpec files under `openspec/changes/<name>/`:
  - `purpose.md` (required)
  - `task.md` (required)
  - `spec.md` (optional)
- [ ] I ran the validation locally: `npm run validate:openspec`
- [ ] CI checks are green

If the PR touches multiple change-sets, please ensure each has its OpenSpec files or explain why.
